# ESG Fund Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis project focused on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) funds. The goal is to evaluate ESG fund performance using a combination of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical techniques, and visualization. The project leverages both Python and R to complete different objectives in a structured, multi-step workflow.

## Repository Contents
- Data Clean.ipynb: Preprocesses and cleans raw ESG fund data. Includes missing value handling and feature formatting.
- Objective 1.ipynb: Conducts initial data exploration, descriptive statistics, and visual analysis of ESG-related metrics.
- Objective 2.R: Performs deeper statistical analysis in R, comparing ESG fund trends and characteristics.
- Objective 3.ipynb: Completes the analysis with advanced visualizations and interpretations based on cleaned datasets.

## Requirements

### Python Notebooks
- Python Version: 3.x
- Required Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

  ```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn```

### R Script
- R Version: 4.x or later
- Required Packages: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr

  ```install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr"))```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:

   ```git clone <repository-url>```

3. Run the Python Notebooks:
   Use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run:
   - Data Clean.ipynb – Clean and prepare the ESG dataset.
   - Objective 1.ipynb – Perform initial analysis.
   - Objective 3.ipynb – Conduct advanced analysis and visuals.

4. Run the R Script:
   Open Objective 2.R in RStudio or another R IDE and run the script for statistical modeling and ESG fund comparison.

## Usage
This project is suitable for anyone looking to:
- Understand ESG fund behavior and trends.
- Practice multi-language data science workflows (Python + R).
- Develop data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization skills.
- Perform ESG-focused financial data research.
