ESG FUND DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT – README

Overview:
This repository contains code files for a multi-objective ESG fund data analysis project. The project uses both Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and R scripts to perform data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. Each file is designed to address a specific objective, from preparing raw data to executing analytical procedures.

Repository Contents:
	1.	Data Clean.ipynb
	•	Description: Contains scripts for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data. Tasks include handling missing values, data transformations, and preliminary exploratory analysis.
	2.	Objective 1.ipynb
	•	Description: Contains code for the first objective. This notebook typically covers initial data exploration and basic analyses.
	3.	Objective 2.R
	•	Description: Contains R code targeting the second objective. It includes data processing, analysis, and visualization using R.
	4.	Objective 3.ipynb
	•	Description: Contains code for the third objective. This notebook is focused on advanced analysis or visualization tasks that build upon prior objectives.

Requirements:

For Python Notebooks:
	•	Python Version: 3.x
	•	Environment: Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
	•	Required Libraries:
	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	Installation Example:
 
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```


For the R Script:
	•	R Version: 4.x (or later recommended)
	•	Required Packages:
	•	dplyr
	•	ggplot2
	•	tidyr
	•	Installation Example (from within R):

```
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr"))
```


Getting Started:
	1.	Clone the Repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
```

	2.	Python Notebooks:
	•	Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
	•	Open and run the notebooks (Objective 1.ipynb, Objective 3.ipynb, and Data Clean.ipynb) in the order appropriate to your workflow. Typically, run Data Clean.ipynb first to prepare the data.
	3.	R Script:
	•	Open the Objective 2.R file using RStudio or your preferred R environment.
	•	Run the script to perform the data analysis specified for this objective.

Usage:
	•	Start with the Data Clean.ipynb notebook to preprocess your data.
	•	Proceed with the analysis notebooks and R script according to the objectives you wish to explore.
	•	Each file includes comments and documentation within the code to explain the steps and logic used.

Thank you for exploring this data analysis project!
